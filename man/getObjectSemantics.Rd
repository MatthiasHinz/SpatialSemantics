\usage{
getObjectSemantics(var, env = globalenv(), isLiteral = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{object or name of the object}

\item{env}{The environment in which the object shall be evaluated}

\item{isLiteral}{TRUE/FALSE allowed. Force var to be interpreted as a literal, even if it is for instance a name of an object in the workspace.}
}
\value{
Returns the semantic reference type of the object.
 If the reference type is unknown because there is no annotation is available, a reference type is estimated based on a heuristic mapping.
 If the mapping is 'unsave', the type will be prefixed with a questionmark '(?)' and a warning is given out.
 For objects, where no semantic mapping is defined, simply the class will be returned
