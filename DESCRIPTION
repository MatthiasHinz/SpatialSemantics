Title: Semantics and provenance for Spatial Statistics
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Matthias Hinz
Maintainer: Matthias Hinz <matthias.m.hinz@gmail.com>
Description: SpatialSemantics records provenance through task-callbacks as
    commands are executed on the R-console. Part of this provenance information is
    a version history maintained for each variable that serves to answer important
    provenance-related questions, namely where, when and how an object has been
    created or modified. Based on the collected information a spatio-temporal data
    derivation graph is constructed that describes all objects, operations, calls
    and their parameters involved in the execution. The graph is enriched with
    semantic annotations in compliance with Scheider et al. [1]. These annotations
    serve to clarify the semantic meaning of a piece of data and to detect semantic
    inconsistencies during the workflow execution. The graph can be vizualized
    and exported using the Rgraphviz-package. Besides the native GraphViz-format
    'dot/gv', many other export formats are supported, for instance pdf, svg,
    png and jpg. [1] Scheider, Simon, et al. "Modeling spatiotemporal information
